- **Phase 4 (Ecosystem Integration)**
  - [#10 - Implement MCP Integration](https://github.com/stephen-cox/nova/issues/10) (Weeks 32-43)

## Strategic Approach: "Easy to Hard"

### **Philosophy**
- **Quick User Satisfaction**: Deliver value within weeks, not months
- **Build Momentum**: Early wins create enthusiasm and adoption
- **Learn and Iterate**: Gather user feedback early to guide complex features
- **Risk Reduction**: Validate approach with simple features before tackling complex ones

### **Trade-offs Accepted**
- **Delayed Core Features**: File operations come later despite being foundational
- **Some Rework**: May need to refactor early features as dependencies are added
- **Dependency Management**: More complex integration work later in timeline

## **Managing the Trade-offs**

### **Dependency Challenges and Solutions**

#### **Challenge 1: File Operations Delayed**
- **Issue**: Advanced features can't use file operations until Week 8
- **Solution**: Design features to work standalone first, add file integration later
- **Example**: Task management stores in memory initially, adds persistence in Phase 2

#### **Challenge 2: Memory System Late**
- **Issue**: Early features don't have cross-session persistence
- **Solution**: Add memory retrofits as Phase 2 features
- **Example**: Web search results cached locally, integrated with memory system later

#### **Challenge 3: Potential Rework**
- **Issue**: Early features may need architecture changes
- **Solution**: Design with extensibility in mind, plan refactoring time
- **Approach**: 20% buffer time in later phases for integration work

### **Technical Debt Management**
```python
# Example: Web Search designed for later memory integration
class WebSearchService:
    def __init__(self, memory_manager=None):  # Optional dependency
        self.memory = memory_manager
        self.local_cache = {}  # Fallback storage

    async def search(self, query: str):
        # Works standalone, enhanced with memory if available
        if self.memory:
            return await self._search_with_memory(query)
        else:
            return await self._search_basic(query)
```
